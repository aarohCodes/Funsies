## Current Status

⚠️ **Missing Files**: The Assets folder is currently empty or missing required files.

## What to Do

1. **Add your own images**: Create or add the required image files listed above
2. **Use placeholders**: The app will work without images, but some visual elements won't display
3. **Create simple icons**: You can use any image editing tool to create simple icon files

## File Specifications

### Recommended Formats
- `.png` for icons and logos (transparent backgrounds preferred)
- `.svg` for scalable graphics (Title logo)
- `.gif` for animations

### Recommended Sizes
- Logo icons: 64x64px to 128x128px
- Small icons: 48x48px
- Background GIF: 1920x1080px (or smaller for performance)

## Note

The application will continue to work without these files, but you'll see broken image icons in the browser. The functionality (eye tracking, voice recording, etc.) is not affected.
